	abstract = {User authentication and key agreement is an important security primitive for creating a securely distributed information system. Additionally, user authentication and key agreement is very useful for providing identity privacy to users. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient user authentication and key agreement scheme using smart cards. The main merits include the following: 1) the computation and communication cost is very low; 2) there is no need for any password or verification table in the server; 3) a user can freely choose and change his own password; 4) it is a nonce-based scheme that does not have a serious time-synchronization problem; 5) servers and users can authenticate each other; 6) the server can revoke a lost card and issue a new card for a user without changing his identity; 7) the privacy of users can be protected; 8) it generates a session key agreed upon by the user and the server; and 9) it can prevent the offline dictionary attack even if the secret information stored in a smart card is compromised.},

@article{Hao2011,
	abstract = {Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) studies how to establish secure communication between two remote parties solely based on their shared password, without requiring a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Despite extensive research in the past decade, this problem remains unsolved. Patent has been one of the biggest brakes in deploying PAKE solutions in practice. Besides, even for the patented schemes like EKE and SPEKE, their security is only heuristic; researchers have reported some subtle but worrying security issues. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem using an approach different from all past solutions. Our protocol, Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling (J-PAKE), achieves mutual authentication in two steps: first, two parties send ephemeral public keys to each other; second, they encrypt the shared password by juggling the public keys in a verifiable way. The first use of such a juggling technique was seen in solving the Dining Cryptographers problem in 2006. Here, we apply it to solve the PAKE problem, and show that the protocol is zero-knowledge as it reveals nothing except one-bit information: whether the supplied passwords at two sides are the same. With clear advantages in security, our scheme has comparable efficiency to the EKE and SPEKE protocols.},

@article{Mackay2012,
	abstract = {The rise of virtualisation and cloud computing is one of the most significant features of computing in the last 10 years. However, despite its popularity, there are still a number of technical barriers that prevent it from becoming the truly ubiquitous service it has the potential to be. Central to this are the issues of data security and the lack of trust that users have in relying on cloud services to provide the foundation of their IT infrastructure. This is a highly complex issue, which covers multiple inter-related factors such as platform integrity, robust service guarantees, data and network security, and many others that have yet to be overcome in a meaningful way. This paper presents a concept for an innovative integrated platform to reinforce the integrity and security of cloud services and we apply this in the context of Critical Infrastructures to identify the core requirements, components and features of this infrastructure.},
